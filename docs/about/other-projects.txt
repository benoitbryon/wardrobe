**************************
Django's template contexts
**************************

Django's template contexts (django.template.context.Context) are also
dictionary-like objects that support push() and pop() methods.

* wardrobe is lighter than Django.

* wardrobe focuses on stack-based datastructures, whereas Django is a web
  framework.

* wardrobe.StackedDict targets general Python usage, whereas Django's Context
  objects are specialized for use in the Django's template language.

* As of Django 1.4, wardrobe.StackedDict instances looks more like standard
  dict objects than Django's Context instances.

* Django could use wardrobe.StackedDict... but, as of Django 1.4, it doesn't
  match the "almost no external dependencies" policy in Django project.
